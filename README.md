=======

iamnear is a small web service, to help you find interesting things that you are near.

It's live at http://iamnear.net.

Feel free to add new categories. Include an easy way of importing the data, I'll merge them back in and deploy.

Some of this code is quite old and nasty. If you wanted to bring it up to date, that'd be lovely.
